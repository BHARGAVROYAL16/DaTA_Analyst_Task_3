In this project, I worked with an e-commerce dataset that included detailed information about customer orders—things like product details, quantities, prices, payment methods, and shipping locations. I imported this data into SQL Workbench to analyze it.

My main goal was to use SQL queries to uncover useful business insights such as sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

Here’s what I did:

I started by exploring the dataset and looking at some sample records.

I identified the top cities by total revenue during the second half of the year.

Using subqueries, I found the most expensive products ordered compared to average order values within each shipping city.

I analyzed how different payment methods performed by calculating total revenue and average order value for each method.

I created SQL views that summarized monthly sales trends and revenue by product category, which helped track overall business performance and identify key product categories to focus on.

Through this project, I applied various SQL techniques like aggregation, filtering, grouping, and creating views to analyze the e-commerce data and generate actionable insights for business decisions.
